Exercise1. Declare a variable my_boolean and assign it the boolean value of true. Print the variable.
my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)
#Exercise2. Declare a variable my_int and assign it the integer value of 3. Print the variable.
my_int = 3
print(my_int)
#Excerise3. Declare a variable my_string and assign it the string value of:This is a string Print the variable.
my_string = "This is a string"
print(my_string)
#Excerise4. Declare a variable my_float and assign it the floating point value of 3.0. Print the variable.
my_float = 3.0
print(my_float)
#Excerise5. Use two print statements to write the following string: Okay, it is time to learn about operators.
print("Okay, ", end='')
print("it is time to learn about operators.")

#Operators
##Coding Exercises
The correct answer is a = 4 and b = 9.
The correct answer is: print(not b and not a or not not c)

var_1 = "Hello"
var_2 = " world"
print(var_1 + var_2)

print(7 // 2)

a = 3.0
b = "2"
print(int(a) + int(b))

#Conditionals
##Coding Exercises

if x > 0 and x < 25 or x > 75 and x < 100:
    print(str(x) + " is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100")

if x % 5 == 0:
    print(str(x) + " is divisible by 5")
else:
    print(str(x) + " is not divisible by 5")

if x % 5 == 0 and x % 2 == 0:
    print(str(x) + " is divisible by 5 and even")
else:
    print(str(x) + " is not divisible by 5 or it is odd")

if x == "red":
    print(x + " is a primary color")
elif x == "blue":
    print(x + " is a primary color")
elif x == "yellow":
    print(x + " is a primary color")
else:
    print(x + " is not a primary color")

if x == "a" or x == "e" or x =="i" or x == "o" or x == "u":
    print(x + " is a vowel")
else:
    print(x + " is not a vowel")
